\usage{
screenPWY(
  pwy_list,
  type = "rank",
  threshold = 0.8,
  cutoff = 0.01,
  value = "pval",
  all_pairs = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pwy_list}{A list of data frames from loadingPWY_cellchat, where each element is a sample
with columns: source, target, pathway, and pval/prob}

\item{type}{Screening method, currently only "rank" is supported.}

\item{threshold}{Proportion of samples in which a pathway must be significant 
to be retained (default is 0.8).}

\item{cutoff}{Significance cutoff threshold (default is 0.01). For pval: values < cutoff are significant. For prob: values > cutoff are significant.}

\item{value}{Type of values in the input, "pval" or "prob"}

\item{all_pairs}{Logical, if TRUE returns all pathways with their ranks, if FALSE returns only 
pathways passing the threshold.}
}
\value{
A data frame of screened pathways with columns:
  source, target, pathway, rank
}
\description{
Screening pathway-level communication based on significance across multiple samples.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load pathway data from CellChat objects
pwy_data <- loadingPWY_cellchat(sample = samples, directory = dirs, value = "pval")
# Screen for consistent pathways
screened <- screenPWY(pwy_data, threshold = 0.8, cutoff = 0.01)
}
